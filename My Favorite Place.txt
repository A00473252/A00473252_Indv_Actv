My favorite place is the childhood version of my home in my mind. Home has changed a lot now, something for better and some for worse. But the version I enjoyed as a child will never come back again. It exists only in my mind and it's different from the version my family members had in their mind, at the same point of time. That's what makes it interesting for me.
