Hey! I'm Subhiksha, a computer science engineering graduate with 2 years of experience as a Data Warehouse Developer for a merchant banking client. My A# is A00473252 and you can reach me at Subhiksha.Ramasubramanian@smu.ca

I enjoyed my work as a data warehouse developer, handling financial data to create back office reports that the business would use to better themselves. Something I really enjoyed was certain analysis that I had to handle and that really interested me. I wanted to learn more about it and thus I chose the CDA program to attain that.

I love learning new things and my hobbies include listening to music, cooking and reading books.
